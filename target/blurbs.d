"Ali's explanations are succinct and on target. I like that he provides rationale for why D was designed in a particular way and how I can use it most effectively. This is the best computer language book I've read." -- Robbin Carlson, Luthier and Enterprise Architect



“I have been using Ali’s online D book to teach D at the university level. It is up-to-date, complete, and most importantly, extremely readable. Having a print version is even better! This is now the 'go-to’ book for learning D programming.” -- Chuck Allison, Professor and Chair, Computer Science Department, Utah Valley University



"This book is one of the best guides through the language that I've seen." -- Andrew Wray, D Enthusiast

"I encourage anyone considering D to read this book. Not exactly  "D for Dummies" but it's easy to follow even if you don't have much experience with compiled languages." -- bachmeier, Reddit user



"Having worked through the book, I have to say this is one of the easiest to follow and distraction free read there is and the fact that it made learning a new language a total breeze really impressed me." -- Imran Khan, Student

"I taught a CS2 Data Structures class in D with more success and student appreciation than when using either C++ or Java as it's an ideal language to express the relevant concepts at all scales, from detailed to big picture, without needless complexity.

Ali Çehreli's tutorial played a central role supporting students especially during the first half of the course --- without it the course simply would not have worked, so "many thanks Ali" --- and an important part of that is its linearity --- it can be read with only backward dependencies. This meant that with hard work even students of little experience and only moderate current abilities could get up to speed, and we saw just that. It is hard to overstate this factor. I unreservedly recommend this book to all." -- Dr. Carl Sturtivant, University of Minnesota Department of Computer Science & Engineering



"D is pristine, clean, immensely powerful, and arguably the actual state-of-the-art programming language. Ali's book is a gem. Clear, concise, and complete." -- Olivier Henley
