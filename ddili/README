This project produces the site ddili.org.

Required tools:

  dmd: Can be obtained at dlang.org. The earliest required version is 2.067.

  make: GNU make that comes with most Linux distributions. Last used version
        was 3.81 but it is likely that other versions will work as well.

  prince: (Not needed for the 'test' target.) A tool that converts from html
          to pdf: http://princexml.com.

To generate the site:

  make -C src

Issues:

- If you receive "unexpected operator" errors from make, it may be because
  /bin/sh is linked to /bin/dash. To see whether that is the case:

  ll /bin/sh

  If you see 'dash' at the end of the line,

  ... /bin/sh -> dash

  you must change it to 'bash':

  sudo rm /bin/sh
  sudo ln -s /bin/bash /bin/sh

- If you don't see the right fonts in Firefox with the 'test' target during
  development, you may have to set "security.fileuri.strict_origin_policy" to
  false in the about:config page.

The outputs of the make process:

  public_html: The directory that contains all of the files of the site.

  public_html.tar.gz: The tarred and zipped version of that directory.

To produce files that are somewhat suitable to open in a browser locally:

  make -C src test

The test output:

  public_html_test: Files that are somewhat more suitable to open locally.

Creating a single pdf:

  There are two copies of each book: The color version (*.pdf) and the
  black-and-white print version (*.print.pdf). You can build these targets
  individually. Unconventionally, they are built inside their respective
  source directories:

  make -C src ders/d.en/Programming_in_D.print.pdf
  make -C src ders/d.en/Programming_in_D.pdf
  make -C src ders/d/D_Programlama_Dili.print.pdf
  make -C src ders/d/D_Programlama_Dili.pdf
  etc.

Creating the ebook version:

1) Make the 'ebook' target

  make -C src ebook

That will produce a tarball that includes all the files for ebook creation:

  ebook_transfer.tar.gz

2) Untar the files where you want to generate the ebooks:

  mkdir ebook_gen
  cd ebook_gen
  tar zxvf ebook_transfer.tar.gz

  The 'ders' directory contains several ebook sources inside separate
  directories. For example, the complete HTML file and the ebook CSS for
  "Programming in D" is under ders/d.en:

  cover_ebook.png
  ebook.css
  ebook_source.d.en.html

3) One of the untarred files is README.ebook. Please continue with the
instructions that are in that file.
