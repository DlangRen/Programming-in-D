This is the template to use for a new book (or a new translation for an existing one).

1) Copy this directory as a new one that you will work on:

  cp -pr template d.de

2) Add the equivalent of the following line to src/Makefile

  include ders/d.de/Makefile.in

3) If missing for your language, implement the proper alphabet class and add it to alphabet.d:

    case "german":
        result = new GermanAlphabet();
        break;

4) This template comes with three chapters and one solution solution chapter (*.cozum.d (cozum is the transliteration of çözüm)) Make the entire project to see that everything builds properly:

  make

5) Edit relevant files in your directory

6) Add new chapters.

If this is a translation, you can copy and paste from e.g. the English version (d.en directory) one by one. Also, keep an eye on changes made to the original so that you can keep the book up to date.
