$(LI
There are three mistakes (bugs) in this program. The first two are with the $(C while) loops: Both of the loop conditions use the $(C <=) operator instead of the $(C <) operator. As a result, the program uses invalid indexes and attempts to access elements that are not parts of the arrays.

$(P
Since it is more beneficial for you to debug the third mistake yourself, I would like you to first run the program after fixing the previous two bugs. You will notice that the program will not print the results. Can you figure out the remaining problem before reading the following paragraph?
)

$(P
The value of $(C i) is 5 when the first $(C while) loop terminates, and that value is causing the logical expression of the second loop to be $(C false), which in turn is preventing the second loop to be entered. The solution is to reset $(C i) to 0 before the second $(C while) loop, for example with the statement $(C i = 0;)
