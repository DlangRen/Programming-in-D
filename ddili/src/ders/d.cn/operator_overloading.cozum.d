$(COZUM_BOLUMU Operator Overloading)

$(P
The following implementation passes all of the unit tests. The design decisions have been included as code comments.
)

$(P
Some of the functions of this struct can be implemented to run more efficiently. Additionally, it would be beneficial to also $(I normalize) the numerator and denominator. For example, instead of keeping the values 20 and 60, the values could be divided by their $(I greatest common divisor) and the numerator and the denominator can be stored as 1 and 3 instead. Otherwise, most of the operations on the object would cause the values of the numerator and the denominator to increase.
