$(UL

$(LI Fundamental contributor from the earliest design stages of a family of networks processor ASICs. Contributed to the development of a family of application aware Ethernet switches. Proposed optimizations that were later implemented in successor chip development.
)

$(LI Implemented low level protocols and tools for ASIC verification, manufacturing diagnostics, and fault isolation. Implemented low level protocols to communicate with line cards over both serial and ethernet ports. Developed tools for ASIC verification, manufacturing diagnostics, and fault isolation. The test methods and programs developed were leveraged from early phases of ASIC design and verification to the eventual deployment into 3rd party manufacturing process flows.
)

$(LI Developed a functional test program to run on a single inexpensive PC to stress test the routing and bridging protocols of a multi-Gigabit switch. Lead developer of diagnostic stress tests utilizing avalanche traffic generation methods within the switch. Hardware multicast, COS queue scheduling and multiple programmable loop-back interfaces were used to advantage. The test program could automatically isolate faults to specific chips and interfaces within the system by dynamically adjusting the program parameters based upon incorrect returned packet data. Stimulus and verification data could be injected and returned at program controlled rates on a single link to enable simple test bench environments suitable for manufacturing.
